# Art & technology

*Session and written by [@NarigoDF](https://twitter.com/NarigoDF).*

We started with the demos of two of my "artsy" projects and went a bit into the details of how they were done.

I've learned about the [processing library](https://processing.org) which seems to be widely used to draw with code. The `p5.js` library is essentially the same for JavaScript.

I think the Saturday session [Shader fun](../#shader-fun) was a bit inspired by talking about art and technology here.

## [Reimemonster](https://github.com/Narigo/reimemonster)

Which is using a word dictionary and a lot of regular expression magic to find out the number of syllables in texts and possible words that rhyme.

## [Dripping spray](https://github.com/Narigo/dripping-spray)

A spray that creates drips when you are spraying on the same spot for a longer time. Thanks to Philip, I now know that I should call it "dripping spray" instead of "dropping spray"... :) I need to check where I still have this typo then.
