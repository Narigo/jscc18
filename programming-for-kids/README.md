# Programming for kids

While we talked a bit about how to get kids into programming, we did not really find a great answer to how to keep them
interested.

- [code.org](https://code.org) seems to be a good resource to learn programming
- [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/) is one of the "learn to code" games
- Showing kids how to cheat in clicker games like [Candy box 2](https://candybox2.github.io/) gets them interested in
  learning JavaScript: "How did you do that!?"

As I don't have kids myself, I've tried to remember what drove me to programming: Learning how to create a computer 
game / text adventure by using the commands I new in DOS for example. Navigating was done more or less by switching 
directories of the game. Maybe it isn't too bad if you don't know so much as a child. You get more creative through the
limitations you face and you don't know how much work you really have to do if you learn along the way...!
